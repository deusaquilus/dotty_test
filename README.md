## Future Dotty-Based Quill Implementation

Compile using sbt `compile` and `test:compile` normally. Currently on M3.

This project should work with metals. To import, go to the
project directory and type `code .` to open VS Code
(note that it will have to be configured beforehand).

The functionality that is currently available is:
 - Equivalent to quill-sql
 - query, insert, delete, update basic functionality
 - basic lift functionality `lift(scalar)` and `insert(lift(caseClass))`.
 - basic parsing of quoted clauses, see `Parser.scala` for details
